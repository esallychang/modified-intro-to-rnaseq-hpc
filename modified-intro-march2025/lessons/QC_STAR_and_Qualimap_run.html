<h2 id="quality-control-for-alignment-data">Quality Control for Alignment Data</h2>

<p>After running Salmon, we now have transcript-level abundance estimates for each of our samples. When Salmon performs the quasi-alignment, internally the algorithm knows the location(s) to which each read is assigned, however this information is not shared with the user. <strong>In order for us to make an assessment on the quality of the mapping we need genomic coordinate information for where each read maps</strong>. Since this is not part of the Salmon output we will need to use a genome alignment tools to <strong>generate a BAM file</strong>. The BAM file will be used as input to a tool called <a href="http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/doc_html/intro.html">Qualimap</a> which computes various quality metrics such as DNA or rRNA contamination, 5’-3’ biases, and coverage biases.</p>

<p><img src="../img/full_workflow_qualimap_2019.png" /></p>

<h2 id="alignment-file-format-sambam">Alignment file format: SAM/BAM</h2>

<p>The <strong>Sequence Alignment Map format</strong> (SAM) file is <strong>a tab-delimited text file that contains all information from the FASTQ file, with additional fields containing alignment information for each read</strong>. Specifically, we can obtain the genomic coordinates of where each read maps to in the genome and the quality of that mapping. A <strong>BAM file is the binary, compressed version of the SAM file</strong>. It is significantly smaller in size and is usually the file format requested for by downstream tools that require alignment data as input. The paper by <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/16/2078.full">Heng Li et al</a> provides a lot more detail on the specification.</p>

<p><img src="/modified-intro-to-rnaseq-hpc/modified-intro-march2025/img/sam_bam.png" alt="SAM1" /></p>

<h2 id="creating-a-bam-file">Creating a BAM file</h2>

<p>To generate a BAM file we need to <strong>map our reads to the genome</strong>. The alignment process consists of choosing an appropriate reference genome to map our reads against and performing the read alignment using one of several splice-aware alignment tools such as <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/25/bioinformatics.bts635">STAR</a> or <a href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml">HISAT2</a>. The choice of aligner is often a personal preference and also dependent on the computational resources that are available to you.</p>

<h3 id="star-aligner">STAR Aligner</h3>

<p>To determine where on the human genome our reads originated from, we will align our reads to the reference genome using <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530905/">STAR</a> (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference). STAR is an aligner designed to specifically address many of the challenges of RNA-seq data mapping using a strategy to account for spliced alignments. We will not go into detail about how STAR works, but if you are interested in undertanding the alignment strategy we have <a href="https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-salmon/lessons/STAR_alignment_strategy.html">some materials linked here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Until recently, the standard approach for RNA-seq analysis has been to map our reads using a splice-aware aligner (i.e STAR) and then use the resulting BAM files as input to counting tools like <a href="http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/">featureCounts</a> and <a href="https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.11.1/count.html">htseq-count</a> to obtain our final expression matrix. The field has now moved towards using lightweight alignment tools like Salmon as standard practice, and so we only use STAR for generating a BAM file. If you are interested in knowing more about the standard approach we have some <a href="https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-salmon/lessons/counting_reads.html">materials linked here</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with this lesson, start an interactive session with 6 cores and 8G of memory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>srun <span class="nt">--pty</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> interactive <span class="nt">-t</span> 0-12:00 <span class="nt">-c</span> 6 <span class="nt">--mem</span> 8G /bin/bash	
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should have a directory tree setup similar to that shown below. It is best practice to have all files you intend on using for your workflow present within the same directory.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rnaseq
	├── logs
	├── meta
	├── raw_data
	│   ├── Irrel_kd_1.subset.fq
	│   ├── Irrel_kd_2.subset.fq
	│   ├── Irrel_kd_3.subset.fq
	│   ├── Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
	│   ├── Mov10_oe_2.subset.fq
	│   └── Mov10_oe_3.subset.fq
	├── results
	└── scripts
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To use the STAR aligner, load the module:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>module load gcc/6.2.0 star/2.7.0a
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similar to Salmon, aligning reads using STAR is <strong>a two step process</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a genome index</li>
  <li>Map reads to the genome</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quick note on shared databases for human and other commonly used model organisms. The O2 cluster has a designated directory at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/n/groups/shared_databases/</code> in which there are files that can be accessed by any user. These files contain, but are not limited to, genome indices for various tools, reference sequences, tool specific data, and data from public databases, such as NCBI and PDB. So when using a tool that requires a reference of sorts, it is worth taking a quick look here because chances are it’s already been taken care of for you.</p>

  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">ls</span> <span class="nt">-l</span> /n/groups/shared_databases/igenome/
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="creating-a-genome-index">Creating a genome index</h3>

<p>For this workshop we are using reads that originate from a small subsection of chromosome 1 (~300,000 reads) and so we are using only chr1 as the reference genome from hg38 without the alternative alleles.</p>

<p>The basic options to <strong>generate genome indices</strong> using STAR are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--runThreadN</code>: number of threads</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--runMode</code>: genomeGenerate mode</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--genomeDir</code>: /path/to/store/genome_indices</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--genomeFastaFiles</code>: /path/to/FASTA_file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--sjdbGTFfile</code>: /path/to/GTF_file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--sjdbOverhang</code>: readlength -1</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>NOTE:</em> In case of reads of varying length, the ideal value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--sjdbOverhang</code> is max(ReadLength)-1. In most cases, the default value of 100 will work similarly to the ideal value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final command to create an index can be found in the job submission script we have linked <a href="/modified-intro-to-rnaseq-hpc/modified-intro-march2025/scripts/star_genome_index.run">here</a>. We have generated the genome indices for you, so that we don’t get held up waiting on the generation of the indices. The index can be found in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/n/groups/hbctraining/intro_rnaseq_hpc/reference_data_ensembl38/ensembl38_STAR_index/</code> directory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> By default the latest human genome build, GRCh38, contains information about alternative alleles for various locations on the genome. If using this version of the GRCh38 genome then it is advisable to use the HISAT2 aligner as it is able to utilize this information during the alignment. There is a version of GRCh38 available that does not have these alleles represented, which is the appropriate version to use with STAR. This is because STAR does not have the functionality to appropriately deal with the presence of alternate alleles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="aligning-reads">Aligning reads</h3>

<p>After you have the genome indices generated, you can perform the read alignment.</p>

<p>Create an output directory for our alignment files:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/rnaseq/raw_data

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir</span> ../results/STAR
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For now, we’re going to work on just one sample to set up our workflow. To start we will use the first replicate in the Mov10 over-expression group, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq</code>. Details on STAR and its functionality can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf">user manual</a>; we encourage you to peruse through to get familiar with all available options.</p>

<p>The basic options for aligning reads to the genome using STAR are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--runThreadN</code>: number of threads / cores</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--readFilesIn</code>: /path/to/FASTQ_file</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--genomeDir</code>: /path/to/genome_indices_directory</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--outFileNamePrefix</code>: prefix for all output files</li>
</ul>

<p>Listed below are additional parameters that we will use in our command:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--outSAMtype</code>: output filetype (SAM default)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--outSAMunmapped</code>: what to do with unmapped reads</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Default filtering is applied in which the maximum number of multiple alignments allowed for a read is set to 10. If a read exceeds this number there is no alignment output. To change the default you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--outFilterMultimapNmax</code>, but for this lesson we will leave it as default. Also, note that “<strong>STAR’s default parameters are optimized for mammalian genomes.</strong> Other species may require significant modifications of some alignment parameters; in particular, the maximum and minimum intron sizes have to be reduced for organisms with smaller introns” [<a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/10/25/bioinformatics.bts635.full.pdf+html">1</a>].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The full command is provided below for you to copy paste into your terminal. If you want to manually enter the command, it is advisable to first type out the full command in a text editor (i.e. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>) on your local machine and then copy paste into the terminal. This will make it easier to catch typos and make appropriate changes.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running our single FASTQ file through the STAR aligner, you should have a number of output files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/rnaseq/results/STAR</code> directory. Let’s take a quick look at some of the files that were generated and explore their content.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd ~/rnaseq/results/STAR

$ ls -lh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What you should see, is that for each FASTQ file you have <strong>5 output files</strong> and a single tmp directory. Briefly, these files are described below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Log.final.out</code> - a summary of mapping statistics for the sample</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam</code> - the aligned reads, sorted by coordinate, in BAM format</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Log.out</code> - a running log from STAR, with information about the run</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Log.progress.out</code> -  job progress with the number of processed reads, % of mapped reads etc., updated every ~1 minute</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SJ.out.tab</code> - high confidence collapsed splice junctions in tab-delimited format. Only junctions supported by uniquely mapping reads are reported</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessing-alignment-quality">Assessing Alignment Quality</h2>

<p>Alignment data files frequently contain biases that are introduced by sequencing technologies, during sample preparation,  and/or the selected mapping algorithm. Therefore, one of the fundamental requirement during analysis of these data is to perform quality control. In this way, we get an idea of <strong>how well our reads align to the reference</strong> and <strong>how well data fit with the expected outcome</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-statistics">Mapping statistics</h3>

<p>Different alignment tools will output a summary of the mapping in different ways. For STAR, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Log.final.out</code> file  contains mapping statistics. Rather than looking at each read alignment, it can be more useful to evaluate statistics that give a general overview for all reads within a sample. Let’s use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code> command to scroll through it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ less Mov10_oe_1_Log.final.out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The log file provides information on reads that 1) mapped uniquely, 2) reads that mapped to mutliple locations and 3) reads that are unmapped. Additionally, we get details on splicing, insertion and deletion. From this file the most informative statistics include the <strong>mapping rate and the number of multimappers</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="qualimap">Qualimap</h3>

<p>In addition to the aligner-specific summary, we can also obtain quality metrics using tools like <a href="http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/doc_html/intro.html#what-is-qualimap">Qualimap</a>, a Java application that aims to facilitate the quality-control analysis of mapping data.</p>

<p>The Qualimap tool takes BAM files as input and explores the features of mapped reads and their genomic properties. It <strong>provides an overall view of the data quality in an HTML report format</strong>. The reports are comprehensive with mapping statistics summarized along with useful figures and tab delimited files of metrics data. We will run Qualimap on a single sample, and then take a detailed look at the report and metrics in comparison to what we would expect for good data.</p>

<p>To <strong>run Qualimap</strong>, change directories to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rnaseq</code> folder and make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qualimap</code> folder inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">results</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/rnaseq

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mkdir</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> results/qualimap
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By default, Qualimap will try to open a GUI to run Qualimap, so we need to run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unset DISPLAY</code> command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">unset </span>DISPLAY
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also need to load the qualimap module:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>module load java/jdk-1.8u112 qualimap/2.2.1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can run Qualimap on our aligned data. There are different tools or modules available through Qualimap, and the <a href="http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/doc_html/command_line.html">documentation</a> details the tools and options available. We are interested in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rnaseq</code> tool. To see the arguments available for this tool we can search the help:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>qualimap rnaseq 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will be running Qualimap with the following specifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-outdir</code>: output directory for html report</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-a</code>: Counting algorithm - uniquely-mapped-reads(default) or proportional (each multi-mapped read is weighted according to the number of mapped locations)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-bam</code>: path/to/bam/file(s)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-p</code>: Sequencing library protocol - strand-specific-forward, strand-specific-reverse or non-strand-specific (default)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-gtf</code>: path/to/gtf/file - <strong>needs to match the genome build and GTF used in alignment</strong></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--java-mem-size=</code>: set Java memory</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>qualimap rnaseq <span class="se">\</span>

<span class="nt">--java-mem-size</span><span class="o">=</span>8G
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Qualimap report should be present in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">results/qualimap</code> directory. To view this report we would need to transfer it over to our local computers. However, this report was generated on a subset of data on chromosome 1; to get a better idea of the metrics we can <strong>take a look at the report of the full dataset for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mov_oe_1</code></strong>, which is available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ck2qdzasthjx7wl/Mov10_oe_1.fastq.qualimap.zip?dl=1">in this zipped folder</a>.</p>

<h4 id="read-alignment-summary"><strong>Read alignment summary</strong></h4>

<p>The first few numbers listed here are similar to what we find in the mapping statistics log file from STAR. Qualimap also computes counts by assigning reads to genes and <a href="http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/doc_html/analysis.html#id7">reports associated statistics</a>. For example, the number of reads aligned to genes, number of ambiguous alignments (belong to several genes) and number of alignments without any feature (intronic and intergenic).</p>

<p><img src="../img/qualimap_read_alignment.png" width="700" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The percentage of mapped reads is a global indicator of the overall sequencing accuracy. We expect between 70-90% of reads to be mapped for the human genome.</li>
    <li>Expect a small fraction of reads to be mapping equally well to multiple regions in the genome (‘multi-mapping reads’).</li>
    <li>The count related metrics are not as relevant to us since we have quantified with Salmon at the transcript level.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="reads-genomic-origin"><strong>Reads genomic origin</strong></h4>
<p>This section reports how many alignments fall into exonic, intronic and intergenic regions along with a number of intronic/intergenic alignments overlapping exons. Exonic region includes 5’UTR,protein coding region and 3’UTR region. This information is summarized in table in addition to a pie chart as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="../img/qualimap_genomic_feature.png" width="700" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Even if you have high genomic mapping rate for all samples, check to see where the reads are mapping. Expect a high proportion of reads mapping to exonic regions (&gt; 60%) and lower intronic mapping rates (20 -30%).</li>
    <li>A higher intronic mapping rate is expected for rRNA removal compared to polyA selection. The intronic reads likely originate from immature transcripts which include either full-length pre-mRNA molecules or nascent transcripts where the RNA polymerase has not yet attached to the 3′ end of the gene.</li>
    <li>A roughly equal distribution of reads mapping to intronic, exonic and intergenic regions suggests that there is DNA contamination.</li>
    <li>Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) constitutes a large majority of the RNA species in any total RNA preparation. Despite depletion methods, you can never achieve complete rRNA removal. Even with Poly-A enrichment a small percentage of ribosomal RNA can stick to the enrichment beads non-specifically. Excess ribosomal content (&gt; 2%) will normally have to be filtered out so that differences in rRNA mapped reads across samples do not affect alignment rates and skew subsequent normalization of the data.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="transcript-coverage-profile"><strong>Transcript coverage profile</strong></h4>
<p>The profile provides ratios between mean coverage at the 5’ region, the 3’ region and the whole transcript. Coverage plots are generated for all genes total, and also for the 500 highest-expressed and 500 lowest-expressed genes separately.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>5’ bias</strong>: the ratio between mean coverage at the 5’ region (first 100bp) and the whole transcript</li>
  <li><strong>3’ bias</strong>: is the ratio between mean coverage at the 3’ region (last 100bp) and the whole transcript</li>
  <li><strong>5’-3’ bias</strong>: is the ratio between both biases.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../img/qualimap_transcript_coverage.png" width="700" /></p>

<p><img src="../img/qualimap_coverage_profile.png" width="700" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>In a perfect sequencing experiment you would expect to see a 5’-3’ bias ratio of 1 with low coverage at both ends of the transcript. This would suggest no bias is present.</li>
    <li>It is well-documented that libraries prepared with polyA selection can lead to high expression in 3’ region (3’ bias). At least <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-6-r86">one study</a> shows the reverse effect for rRNA removal.</li>
    <li>If reads primarily accumulate at the 3’ end of transcripts in poly(A)-selected samples, this might indicate low RNA quality in the starting material.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="junction-analysis"><strong>Junction Analysis</strong></h4>

<p>Qualimap also reports the total number of reads mapping to splice junctions and the 10 most frequent junction rates. The pie chart shows analysis of junction positions in spliced alignments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Known category represents percentage of alignments where both junction sides are known.</li>
  <li>Partly known represents alignments where only one junction side is known.</li>
  <li>All other alignments with junctions are marked as Novel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other tools like <a href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/rna-seqc">RNASeQC</a> will plot figures that can help evaluate <strong>GC content bias</strong>. This is also an important aspect of QC, as low/high GC content regions will tend to have low coverage.</p>

<p>Taken together, these metrics give us some insight into the quality of our samples and help us in identifying any biases present in our data. The conclusions derived from these QC results may indicate that we need to correct for these biases and so you may want to go back and modify the parameters for Salmon (mapping) accordingly.</p>
